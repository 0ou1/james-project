          <p>Consult <a href="https://github.com/apache/james-project/tree/master/server/app/src/main/resources/jmx.properties">jmx.properties</a> in GIT to get some examples and hints.</p>

          <p>This is used to configure the JMX MBean server via which management can be achieved (also used by the james-cli).
          Alternatives include <a href="manage-webadmin.html">WebAdmin</a></p>

          <dl>
              <dt><strong>jmx.address</strong></dt>
              <dd>The IP address (host name) the MBean Server will bind/listen to.</dd>
              <dt><strong>jmx.port</strong></dt>
              <dd>The port number the MBean Server will bind/listen to.</dd>
          </dl>

          <p>To access from a remote location, it has been reported that -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.ssl=false is
              needed in the startup script.</p>
