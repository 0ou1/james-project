    </properties>

    <body>

        <section name="Tika Configuration">

            <p>When using ElasticSearch, you can configure an external Tika server for extracting and indexing text from attachments.
                Thus you can significantly improve user experience upon text searches.</p>

            <p>Note that to use this feature you need Guice, built with ElasticSearch</p>

            <p>Consult <a href="https://github.com/apache/james-project/blob/master/dockerfiles/run/guice/cassandra/destination/conf/tika.properties">tika.properties</a> to get some examples and hints.</p>

            Here are the different properties:

            <dl>
                <dt><strong>tika.host</strong></dt>
                <dd>IP or domain name of your Tika server. The default value is 127.0.0.1</dd>
                <dt><strong>tika.port</strong></dt>
                <dd>Port of your tika server. The default value is 9998</dd>
                <dt><strong>tika.timeoutInMillis</strong></dt>
                <dd>Timeout when issuing request to the tika server. The default value is 3 seconds.</dd>
            </dl>

            <p>Note: You can launch a tika server using this command line:</p>

            <code><pre>docker run --name tika logicalspark/docker-tikaserver:1.15rc2</pre></code>

            <p>You need to know that Tika is a complex service, which implies a performance penalty. Furthermore,
            you may want to customize the parsers used by Tika in order to avoid low-value and high-cost operations.</p>
