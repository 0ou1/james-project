        <section name="Server Wide Configuration">

            <subsection name="Introduction">

                <p>There are a number of global configuration files that do not fall into any one
                    component. They have effects that are global in scope across the server.</p>

                <p>Some of these files are crucial, while others can be ignored by any but the most sophisticated
                    server administrators.</p>

            </subsection>

            <subsection name="spring-server.xml">

                <p>In James distribution, the spring files are located under conf/context folder and splitted into a main
                    file (james-server-context.xml) which imports 4 other files (1 per mailbox type): james-mailbox-jcr-context.xml, james-mailbox-jpa-context.xml,
                    james-mailbox-maildir-context.xml, james-mailbox-memory-context.xml.</p>

                <p>Consult <a href="https://github.com/apache/james-project/tree/master/server/container/spring/src/main/resources/META-INF/org/apache/james/spring-server.xml">spring-server.xml</a> in GIT to
                    get some examples and hints.</p>

                <p>spring beans files are the place where the Apache James Server wiring is done. It should be modified only by expert-users.</p>

                <p>In combination with james-database.properties and META-INF/persistence.xml, the datasource to access the database is defined in spring-server.xml</p>

            </subsection>

            <subsection name="META-INF/persistence.xml">

                <p>Consult <a href="https://github.com/apache/james-project/tree/master/server/app/src/main/resources/META-INF/persistence.xml">META-INF/persistence.xml</a> in GIT to get some examples and hints.</p>

                <p>The JPA mapping and properties are defined in the in META-INF/persistence.xml.</p>

                <p>You can override the definition in external file and importing the external file in the persistence.xml (see jpa-mappings.xml provided example in GIT)</p>

                <source>
                    &lt;mapping-file&gt;META-INF/jpa-mappings.xml&lt;/mapping-file&gt;</source>

            </subsection>

            <subsection name="sqlResources.xml">

                <p>Consult <a href="https://github.com/apache/james-project/tree/master/server/app/src/main/resources/sqlResources.xml">sqlResources.xml</a> in GIT to get some examples and hints.</p>

                <p>This file is deprecated but some mailets... still need it. The standard way to access database
                    is JPA, but some functionalities are not yet migrated and still need the sqlResources.xml resources.</p>

                <p>The precise SQL statements used by Apache James Server to modify and view data stored in the database
                    are specified in sqlResources.xml file.</p>

                <p>If you are using a SQL database with unusual SQL commands or data types, you may
                    need to add special entries to this file.  The James team
                    does try to keep sqlResources.xml updated, so if you do run into a
                    special case, please let us know.</p>

                <p>Also, if the database tables are not created a priori, but rather are to be created by James
                    upon startup, special attention should be paid to the "create table" statements in this file.  Such
                    statements tend to be both very database and very database instance specific.</p>

            </subsection>

            <subsection name="JCR Repository Configuration">

                <p>Consult <a href="https://github.com/apache/james-project/tree/master/server/app/src/main/resources/jcr-repository.xml">jcr-repository.xml</a> in GIT to get some examples and hints.</p>

                <p>Used to configure the JCR mailbox (if configure in mailbox.xml).</p>
