= James Local Mail Server
:navtitle: Local

If you are not sure which server you should be using, then
you probably ought to be using the Local Server.

At this time, the server is not entirely "out-of-the-box", because there
is some work you will have to do in order to get the server up and running.
However, the work that needs to be done is quite minimal. We will walk you
through the configuration in these documents. Hopefully in the near future
the installation will be made even simpler.
