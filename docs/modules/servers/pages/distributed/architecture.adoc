= Distributed Server Architecture

This sections presents the Distributed Server architecture.

In order to deliver its promises, the Distributed Server leverages the following storage strategies:

(TODO picture)

 * *Cassandra* is used for metadata storage
 * The *blob store* storage interfaces is responsible of storing potentially large binary data. For instance
 email bodies, headers or attachments. Different technologies can be used: *Cassandra*, or *Object Storage*
(S3 or Swift)
 * *ElasticSearch* component enpower full text search on emails.
 * *RabbitMQ* enables James nodes of a same cluster to collaborate together.
 * *Tika* (optional) enables text extraction from attachments, thus improving full text search results.
 * *SpamAssassin* (optional) can be used for Spam detection and user feedback is supported.
