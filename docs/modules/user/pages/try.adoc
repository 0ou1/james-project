= Try James in 5 minutes
:navtitle: Try

Requirements: 

 * Docker
 * Docker-compose

Retrieve the docker-compose file:

    $ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/james-project/master/dockerfiles/run/docker-compose.yml

Start:

    $ docker-compose up

When James is available:

james           | Started : true

A default domain, james.local, has been created. You can see this by running:

    $ docker exec james java -jar /root/james-cli.jar -h 127.0.0.1 -p 9999 listdomains

James will respond to IMAP port 143 and SMTP port 25.
You have to create users before playing with james. You may also want to create other domains.
Follow the 'Useful commands' section for more information about James CLI.
