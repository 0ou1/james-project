== Overview

// "Repository" should be "Diretory". See JAMES-3360.
Once a system grows over time to contain many users or perhaps many messages
stored in its xref:storage/mailbox.adoc[Mailbox] or xref:storage/users.adoc[User Repository],
searching for the right user or email becomes increasingly difficult. At some point
it becomes useful to use an https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_indexing[indexing]
system.
