        <section name="ManageSieve Server Configuration">

            <p>Consult <a href="https://github.com/apache/james-project/tree/master/server/app/src/main/resources/managesieveserver-template.xml">
                managesieveserver-template.xml</a> in GIT to get some examples and hints.</p>

            <p>The ManageSieve service is controlled by a configuration block in the managesieveserver.xml.
                The managesieveserver tag defines the boundaries of the configuration block. It encloses
                all the relevant configuration for the  ManageSieve Server. The behavior of the ManageSieve Server service is
                controlled by the attributes and children of this tag.</p>

            <p>This tag has an optional boolean attribute - <strong>enabled</strong> - that defines whether the service
                is active or not.  The value defaults to "true" if not present.</p>

            <p>The standard children of the managesieveserver tag are:</p>

            <dl>
                <dt><strong>bind</strong></dt>
                <dd>Configure this to bind to a specific inetaddress. This is an optional integer value.  This value is the port
                    on which this ManageSieve Server server is configured to listen. If the tag or value is absent then the service
                    will bind to all network interfaces for the machine If the tag or value is omitted, the value will default to
                    the standard ManageSieve port 4190 is the well-known/IANA registered port for ManageSieve</dd>
                <dt><strong>tls</strong></dt>
                <dd>Set to true to support STARTTLS or SSL for the Socket.
                    To use this you need to copy sunjce_provider.jar to /path/james/lib directory. To create a new keystore execute:
                    keytool -genkey -alias james -keyalg RSA -keystore /path/to/james/conf/keystore</dd>
                <dt><strong>handler.connectiontimeout</strong></dt>
                <dd>Connection timeout in secconds</dd>
                <dt><strong>handler.connectionLimit</strong></dt>
                <dd>Set the maximum simultaneous incoming connections for this service</dd>
                <dt><strong>handler.connectionLimitPerIP</strong></dt>
                <dd>Set the maximum simultaneous incoming connections per IP for this service</dd>
            </dl>
