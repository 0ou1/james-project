= Guice-Memory Module How-to

== Requirements

 * Java 11 SDK

== Running

To run james, you have to create a directory containing required configuration files.

James requires the configuration to be in a subfolder of working directory that is called
**conf**. A sample directory is provided with some default values you may need to replace.
You will need to update its content to match your needs.

You also need to generate a keystore with the following command:

[source]
----
$ keytool -genkey -alias james -keyalg RSA -keystore conf/keystore
----

Once everything is set up, you just have to run the jar with:

[source]
----
$ java -Dworking.directory=. -Dlogback.configurationFile=conf/logback.xml -jar james-server-memory-guice.jar
----

Note that binding ports below 1024 requires administrative rights.
