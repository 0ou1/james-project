Subject: Apache James Project suggestions for Google Summer of code

Hi every one!

The Google of Code registration period of the year is already here...

The Apache James project is willing to join this edition. You can read more about it [here]

Here are some ideas of tasks we can propose mentoring on!

 - [JAMES-1931] Build a WebAdmin user interface (website)
 - [JAMES-1932] Mail processing edition and debugging tool
 - [JAMES-1933] SPF, DKIM, DMARC implementation and documentation
 - [JAMES-XXXX] Configuration providers abstraction.

Don't hesitate to propose your owns. Also you can come and discuss this on [our gitter channel].

Cheers,

Benoit Tellier in the behalf of the Apache James developers.
