*James* stands for *Java Apache Mail Enterprise Server!*

It has a modular architecture based on a rich set of *modern* and *efficient* components which provides at the end
*complete, stable, secure and extendable Mail Servers running on the JVM*.

Create your *own personal solution* for emails treatment by assembling the components you need thanks to the Inversion
of Control mail platform offered and  go further customizing filtering and routing rules using *James Mailet Container*.

Supported protocols are: IMAP, SMTP, link:https://jmap.io[JMAP], POP3 and more...

The link:https://james.staged.apache.org/james-project/3.7.0/servers/distributed.html[*Distributed server*] focuses on delivering a easy-to-operate scalable mail server based on modern technologies
(Cassandra, S3, ElasticSearch and RabbitMQ).

== How to try James

Requirements: docker & docker-compose installed.

When you try James this way, you will use the most current state of James.
It will be configured to run with Cassandra & ElasticSearch.
All those three components will be started with a single command.

You can retrieve the docker-compose file :

    $ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/james-project/master/server/apps/distributed-app/docker-compose.yml

Then, you just have to start the services:

    $ docker-compose up

Wait a few seconds in order to have all those services start up. You will see the following log when James is available:
james           | Started : true

A default domain, james.local, has been created. You can see this by running:

    $ docker exec james james-cli listdomains

James will respond to IMAP port 143 and SMTP port 25.
You have to create users before playing with james. You may also want to create other domains.
Follow the 'Useful commands' section for more information about James CLI.

== How to check the compilation

We require link:https://maven.apache.org[maven] version 3.6.0 minimum to build the project.

Simply run `mvn clean install` within this directory to compile the project.

Useful options includes:

 - `-DskipTests` to skip the long to execute resource consuming test suite that requires a docker daemon.
 - `-T 4` to parallelize the build on several CPUs.

== How to run James in Docker

We maintain docker distribution for our Guice based applications :

 * link:https://github.com/apache/james-project/blob/master/server/apps/distributed-app/README.adoc[Guice + Cassandra + RabbitMQ + S3 + ElasticSearch (distributed)]
 * link:https://github.com/apache/james-project/blob/master/server/apps/cassandra-app/README.adoc[Guice + Cassandra + ElasticSearch]
 * link:https://github.com/apache/james-project/blob/master/server/apps/jpa-app/README.adoc[Guice + JPA + Lucene]
 * link:https://github.com/apache/james-project/blob/master/server/apps/memory-app/README.md[Guice + Memory (testing)]

== Using the CLI

See https://james.apache.org/server/manage-cli.html[Manage James via the Command Line] for more info.

== Develop on James

James requires at least JDK 11 and Maven 3.6.0 to build.
Some parts of James are written in Scala so one might need to enable Scala plugin in IDE.

We maintain link:examples/README.md[code examples] to help you write your own extensions and wire your own servers.

link:docs/modules/development/pages/deployment-tests.adoc[This page] details how to run deployment Tests.

== Know more about James design

James comes with a https://james.apache.org/documentation.html[Documentation] and https://github.com/linagora/james-project/tree/master/src/adr[Architectural Decision Records].

A more precise description of the *Distributed Server* architecture can be found
link:https://james.staged.apache.org/james-project/3.7.0/servers/distributed/architecture/index.html[here].
